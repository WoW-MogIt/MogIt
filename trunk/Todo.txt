== 6.0 ==
- Localization (just needs running + uploading when we're finished)
- Maybe add headers to the difficulties in the source filter
- Check previews are working

- Update extra modules

- Add support for illusions and localised enchant names in Enchants.lua (for the future)
- Figure out if/how we will support bonusID in Tokens.lua -- should not be very difficult simply using item strings
- Model tooltip doesn't reset when moving cursor quickly to another item.
