== 6.0 ==
- Module imports are grouping non-identical items together - check what's causing that - probably display ID in extractor
- Check module data is correct - missing items (due to "not obtainable") and difficulties (think warforged is wrong)
- Fix/check Links.lua and Preview.lua ("item1,bonus1:item2,bonus2:item3:item4")
- Possibly add support for bonus ID for items in URL.lua
- Wishlist conversion (numerical -> string, or support numerical everywhere in addon? might already work!)
- Figure out if/how we will support bonusID in Tokens.lua
- License txt file / Localization (just needs running + uploading when we're finished)
- Update extra modules
- Add support for illusions and localised enchant names in Enchants.lua (for the future)
